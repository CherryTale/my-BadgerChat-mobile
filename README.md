# Hi there!

This repository hosts a project called BadgerChat-mobile, an online chatroom/forum.

* The project uses react-native to create a Android/ios app which has functionality such as register, login, logout, post and delete.
* It interacts with a real HTTP API (Check API_DOCUMENTATION.md), and uses expo-secure-store to mantain/consume login status.
* I also use react-navigation to create a intuitive user interface.

To run the program, you'll need a Badger ID.

There is also a web version of this App, check [here](https://github.com/CherryTale/my-BadgerChat).
